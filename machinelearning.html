<u><i><h1 style="background-color:skyblue">Artificial intelligence</h1></i></u>


<p>As a scientific endeavor, <small>machine learning</small> grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. In the early days of AI as an <ins><mark style="color:blue"><abbr title="An academic discipline or academic field is a subdivision of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university leve">academic discipline</abbr></mark></ins>, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what was then termed <ins><mark style="color:blue"><abbr title="A neural network is a network or circuit of biological neurons, or, in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes."><q>neural networks</q></abbr></mark></ins>; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.</p>

<p>Machine learning (ML), reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, <ins><mark style="color:blue"><abbr title="Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth value of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false.">fuzzy logic</abbr></mark></ins>, and probability theory.</p>


<u><b><h2>Data Mining</h2></b></u>
<hr>

<p><main>Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods</main> and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on <i>known</i> properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) <i>unknown</i> properties in the data. Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as <q>unsupervised learning</q> or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, <abbr style="color:blue" title=" European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases">ECML PKDD</abbr> being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in <abbr style="color:blue" title="knowledge discovery and data mining">KDD</abbr> the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. </p>

<u><b><h2>Optimization</h2></b></u>
<hr>

<p>Machine learning also has intimate ties to <cite>optimization</cite>: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some <ins><mark style="color:blue"><abbr title="a loss function or is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some cost associated with the event">loss function</abbr></mark></ins> on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples).</p>

<u><b><h2>Generalization</h2></b></u>
<hr>

<p>The difference between <code>optimization and machine learning</code> arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples. Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. </p>

	<dl>
		<b><dt>Supervised learning:</dt></b>
		<dd>The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.</dd>
		<b><dt>Unsupervised learning:</dt></b>
		<dd>No labels are given to the learning <sup>algorithm</sup> , leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end.</dd>
		<b><dt>Reinforcement learning:</dt></b>
		<dd>A computer program interacts with a dynamic<sub>environment</sub>  inwhich it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent).</dd>
